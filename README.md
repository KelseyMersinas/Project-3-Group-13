# Project-3-Group-13

This web app explores data through an interactive application. We aim to provide insightful analysis to meteorite landings and their distributions. NASA estimates that any given hour several meteorites can be seen falling through our atmosphere. While most burn up several thousand will still land on our planet. 
By using interactive maps to visualize meteorite landings we can highlight the impact of space on our planet and can show the distributions of these meteorites. 
Using both leaflet and javascript we can add information to our plots to paint a picture of how these meteorites are distributed.  

## Research questions

1. Are there any common locations where meteorites are touching down?
2. What are the sizes of these meteorites when they get to earth and are the sizes affecting their landing?
3. Has the frequency of these landings changed over time?
